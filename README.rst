Haskell2Scala
=============

Description
-----------

This application is a prototype of a Haskell interpreter purely written in Scala in order to demonstrate what the authors have learned from Programming Paradigms classes, using many of functional programming skills.

How to Run
----------

We do not exactly remember, one might try compiling these \*.scala files using some Scala 2.6 compiler. After that, you run the resultant classes just like you execute a regular Java application.
